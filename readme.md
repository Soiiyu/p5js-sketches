# p5.js Sketches

This repository contains my p5.js sketches and projects.
Feel free to explore them in the [projects folder](/projects), though many of them aren't well documented.
I might go through them and add some proper instructions and comments in the future.

## Overview

**Running locally** can be done by executing `node .` in the parent folder. 
An express server will host all the projects on `localhost`, with a basic directory page.

[p5.js](https://p5js.org/) is an open source JavaScript library for creative coding, with a focus on making coding accessible and inclusive for artists, designers, educators, beginners, and anyone else!
